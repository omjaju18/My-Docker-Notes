## **Docker Containers – Detailed Explanation** 🐳  

---

### **🔹 What is a Docker Container?**  
A **Docker container** is a **lightweight, standalone, executable package** that runs software, including:  
- Application code  
- Libraries and dependencies  
- Environment variables  
- Configuration files  

Containers run **isolated from the host system** but share the host OS kernel, making them **faster and more efficient** than virtual machines.  

In simple terms:  
- A **Docker image** is like a **blueprint** (static).  
- A **Docker container** is a **running instance of an image** (dynamic).  

---

### **🔹 Why Use Docker Containers?**  
✅ **Portability** — "Works on my machine" becomes "Works everywhere."  
✅ **Lightweight** — No need for a full OS for each app (unlike VMs).  
✅ **Scalable** — Spin up multiple containers easily.  
✅ **Isolation** — Each container has its own filesystem, processes, etc.  
✅ **Fast startup** — Containers start in **seconds**.

### **🔹 Docker Container Lifecycle**  

| **Stage**    | **Command**                  | **Explanation**                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Create**   | `docker create`             | Creates a new container (but doesn't start it) |
| **Start**    | `docker start`              | Starts a stopped container              |
| **Run**      | `docker run`                | Creates + Starts a container in one go  |
| **Stop**     | `docker stop`               | Gracefully stops a running container    |
| **Kill**     | `docker kill`               | Forcefully stops a running container    |
| **Restart**  | `docker restart`            | Stops and starts a container           |
| **Pause**    | `docker pause`              | Suspends processes in a container       |
| **Unpause**  | `docker unpause`            | Resumes processes in a container        |
| **Remove**   | `docker rm`                 | Deletes a stopped container            |
| **Logs**     | `docker logs`               | Displays container logs                |

### **🔹 Running Containers**  

#### **1⃣ Create and Start a Container (Basic)**  
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx
```

**Explanation:**  
- `docker run` — Creates and starts a new container  
- `-d` — Detached mode (runs in the background)  
- `-p 8080:80` — Maps port **80 (inside container)** to **8080 (host)**  
- `--name my-nginx` — Names the container `my-nginx`  
- `nginx` — Uses the **nginx image** from Docker Hub  

👉 **Access** the Nginx server by visiting:  
```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

#### **2⃣ List Running Containers**  
```bash
docker ps
```

👉 Shows only **running** containers.  

To list **all containers** (including stopped ones):  
```bash
docker ps -a
```

---

#### **3⃣ Stop a Running Container**  
```bash
docker stop my-nginx
```

👉 Gracefully stops the `my-nginx` container (sends **SIGTERM** signal).  

For **force stop**:  
```bash
docker kill my-nginx
```
👉 Uses **SIGKILL** to stop it immediately.

---

#### **4⃣ Remove a Stopped Container**  
```bash
docker rm my-nginx
```

👉 Deletes the `my-nginx` container from your system.  

To remove **all stopped containers** at once:  
```bash
docker container prune
```

---

### **🔹 Accessing Running Containers**  

#### **1⃣ Execute a Command in a Running Container**  
```bash
docker exec -it my-nginx sh
```

**Explanation:**  
- `exec` — Run a command inside the container  
- `-it` — Interactive terminal (for shell access)  
- `my-nginx` — Container name  
- `sh` — Starts a shell session (for Alpine or Nginx-based containers)  

👉 Now you are **inside the container** — you can check files, logs, etc.

---

#### **2⃣ View Logs of a Container**  
```bash
docker logs my-nginx
```

👉 Shows logs generated by the app running inside the container.

For **real-time logs**:  
```bash
docker logs -f my-nginx
```

---

### **🔹 Committing Changes to a Container**  
If you make changes inside a running container and want to save them as a new image:

```bash
docker commit my-nginx my-custom-nginx
```

👉 Creates a new Docker image called `my-custom-nginx` containing the changes.

---

### **🔹 Inspect a Container**  
To get detailed information about a container:

```bash
docker inspect my-nginx
```

👉 Displays **IP address, mount points, networks, environment variables**, etc.

### **🔹 Container vs Image Recap**  

| **Aspect**       | **Docker Image**              | **Docker Container**           |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Definition**   | Blueprint for containers     | Running instance of an image   |
| **State**        | Static (doesn’t run)         | Dynamic (running or stopped)   |
| **Purpose**      | Stores app + dependencies    | Executes the app               |
| **Storage**      | Stored in Docker registry    | Stored in host filesystem      |
| **Command**      | `docker build`, `docker pull` | `docker run`, `docker start`   |

---

### **🔹 Conclusion**  

- **Docker containers** run apps in isolated environments without the overhead of VMs.  
- They are **fast, portable, and scalable**.  
- Containers are created from **images** — you can build, run, stop, and remove them easily.
